<h2>Java Spring Backend with REST API</h2>

<h3>This GitHub repository hosts the backend implementation of an application, developed using the Java Spring framework and exposing a RESTful API for communication with the frontend. Yhis application has bin developed as our task for BEST(Board of European Students of Technology) HACKATHON.</h3>

<h4>The site for which the backend is being developed: <a href="https://github.com/maxxlab/maxxlab.github.io">Our Project</a> 
FinHelper is a financial planner application developed for a hackathon. It leverages PostgreSQL, a powerful open-source relational database management system (RDBMS), to store and manage financial data for users, cards, operations, transactions, and more.
</h4>

<h3>The technology stack that was applied:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Java: The primary programming language used for backend development.</li>
    <li>Spring Framework: Utilizing the Spring ecosystem, including Spring Boot and Spring Data JPA.</li>
    <li>REST API: Building a RESTful API for communication with the frontend and other services.</li>
    <li>PostgreSQL: Storing and managing financial data using the PostgreSQL database.</li>
    <li>Maven: Managing project dependencies and build process.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<h4>The application provides various features for financial planning and management. Users can perform actions such as:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Register and manage their user accounts</li>
    <li>Add, update, and remove cards associated with their accounts</li>
    <li>Perform financial operations like deposits, withdrawals, and transfers</li>
    <li>Track transactions and view transaction history</li>
    <li>Get a detailed statistic on your finances and possible investments</li>
</ul>

<h4>Once the application backend is up and running, it exposes a REST API that can be utilized by the frontend or other services. The API provides endpoints for user management, card management, financial operations, and transaction tracking.</h4>
